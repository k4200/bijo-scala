This small web application is "inspired" by Bijo-Linux.

I started it just for fun and my learning of Scala and Lift.

Although it's small, it has some features that not many people
have done in Scala and Lift, such as image upload, CRUD, and so on.
It also uses some new features introduced in Lift 2.2, such as CSS
selectors and ... what else? So, it might be of some use for newbies.

This is a sbt project, which you should be used to if you're a
Scala programmer, and also an Eclipse project. .project was made
by a cool program called SbtEclipsify.
